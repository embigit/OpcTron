# OPC UA for Î¼ITRON (OpcTron)

## What is OpcTron?

OpcTron is a port of open62541 to uITRON RTOS platform. OpcTron consists set of ready-to-use header files, library and sample application programs to facilitate quick evaluation and deployment of OPC UA (OPC Unified Architecture) on embedded targets.

## What are special features of OpcTron?

### Dedicated support for uITRON

   open62541
### Cross-compile made easy!

Though very much user friendly, cross-compiling open62541 needs significant efforts. OpcTron includes the workspace for the following IDEs through which the library and the example programs can be built just with few clicks.

* IAR Embedded Workbench for ARM
* Arm Development Studio-5
* Keil Microcontroller Development Kit
* Renesas Electronics e2studio
* Texas Instruments Code Composer Studio
* Xilinx Software Development Kit
* Intel NIOS II Embedded Design Suite

### Ready-to-run embedded targets

The client and server programs are tested for the following embedded targets and the workspace for building the executable is readily available for download.
